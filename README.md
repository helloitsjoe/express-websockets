# Express WebSockets Example

Server-side code is in `server.js`, client-side code is in `index.js`.

Note that I tried to keep this as simple as possible, but I would structure this differently if this
were a production app.

## To start

1. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Start the Express server by running `yarn start` or `npm start`
3. Go to `localhost:3000`
