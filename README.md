# Express WebSockets Example

Server-side code is in `server.js`, client-side code is in `index.js`.

Note: I tried to keep this as simple as possible, but I would structure it differently if this were
a production app.

## To start

1. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Start the Express server by running `yarn start` or `npm start`
3. Open two browser windows to `localhost:3000`, and/or a mobile device to the IP address in the
   terminal message.
4. Send messages!
